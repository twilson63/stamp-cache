# Stamp-Cache

Uses Warp 1.1.14 to create a server side cache of the StampCoin Test contract.

This should result is fast reads of contract state!

TODO: 

Lets make it decentalized, so any one can run a server
Lets use P3 to accept payments to use the service
Lets use STAMP COIN for those payments
Lets add FP-JSON to support filtering state via a POST /:contract
